# Fligno Crash Course Python Files

This repo includes all the code found in the google slides and the facebook page upload bot for you to experiment and use.

### Setup (Training Files)
You need these installed on your computer
 - Python 3
 - Pip
 - Flake8 (for linting)
 
Just open them with your favorite code editor of choice. Chances are they already feature a run button for your python code.

or you can run them via the terminal with `python <filename.py>`

### Setup (Facebot)
Same requirements as above but with some additions
 - Python venv
 - Facebook API Token

In order to setup the bot.
 
 1. Install venv and navigate to the bot folder `cd Facebot`
 2. Start the venv via `source ./venv/bin/activate`
 3. Install pip packages from requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 4. Run via terminal with `python main.py` (assuming your default python version is > 3)  


I hope you learned something from this TED talk.
